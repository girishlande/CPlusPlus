WISDOM
--------

>Most of the time people say that things should be fair to everyone. 
SO if 2 persons are buying something which costs 100rs then Ideally both persons should pay 50rs each.
But Is this world really fair. Is the mother nature fair with everyone ? 
Some people are born blind when most of the people have their eyes. Is Nature fair with Blind people ? Can anyone trade their eyes for any amount of money ? 
Some people are born with missing hands/legs/genitals/deformed body parts/defective eyes/ defective hearing abilities and so on.
Is nature fair with them ?

>people born in same family have completely different fate. They look different. They live different lives. They die at different time.
So where is fairness ??
When god doesn't offer fair things who are we to assume that everyone should get fair things?
All we can do is try our best with our tiny minds to make things fair for everyone but in reality we can never ensure fairness.

How to Win Friends and Influence People Summary
---------------------------------------------------------
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.

Criticism is futile because it puts us on the defensive and usually makes us strive to justify ourselves. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds our pride, hurts our sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

Don’t criticize others; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.

“Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbor’s roof when your own doorstep is unclean.”—Confucius

We’re not logical; we’re emotional, motivated by pride and vanity.

“I will speak ill of no man and speak all the good I know of everybody.”—Benjamin Franklin

Rather than condemn others, try to understand them. Try to figure out why they do what they do.

We all want to be appreciated.

“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people. The greatest asset I possess and t way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.”—Charles Schwab

Before trying to persuade someone to do something, ask yourself, “How can I make this person want to do it?”

“If there is any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”—Henry Ford

“You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.”

“It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.”  

Encourage others to talk about themselves.

Always make the others feel important.

Most people you meet will feel superior to you in some way. A sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.

“Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.”—Disraeli

“If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s good will.”

How to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:

Welcome the disagreement
Distrust your first instinctive impression
Control your temper
Listen first
Look for areas of agreement
Be honest
Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully
Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest
Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem
“There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: ‘I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.’”

“Don’t argue with your customer or your spouse or your adversary. Don’t tell them they are wrong. Don’t get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.”

“If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves?”

“Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say—and say them before that person has a chance to say them.”

When you’re right, try to win people gently and tactfully to your way of thinking. When you’re wrong, admit your mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm.

“In talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose. Get the other person saying, ‘Yes, yes’ at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying ‘No.’”

“Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that”

“If, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing—an increased tendency to think always in terms of the other person’s point of view, and see things from that person’s angle as well as your own—if you get only that one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the stepping—stones of your career.”

How to stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other person listen attentively: “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.”

“Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.”

It’s always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.

“Calling attention to one’s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism.”

“It isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.”

“Admitting one’s own mistakes—even when one hasn’t corrected them—can help convince somebody to change his behavior.”

“People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.”

“Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere—not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.”

“If you want to improve a person in a certain aspect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.”

“Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite technique—be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it—and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.”

“Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.”

The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behavior:   

Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person
Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do
Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants
Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest
Match those benefits to the other person’s wants
When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Book in Three Sentences
Success encompasses a balance of personal and professional effectiveness.
Before you can adopt the seven habits, you need to change your perception and interpretation of how the world works (see: paradigm shift).
Between what happens to you and your response to it is your freedom to choose that response.
The Five Big Ideas
Proactive people work on the things they can do something about.
Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.
A paradigm is a way to “see” the world.
We see the world, not as it is, but as we are conditioned to “see” it.
To make relatively minor changes in your life, focus on your attitudes and behaviors. To make significant, quantum change, work on your basic paradigms.

To make relatively minor changes in your life, focus on your attitudes and behaviors. To make significant, quantum change, work on your basic paradigms

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Summary
---------------------------------------------------
“Leadership is communicating others’ worth and potential so clearly that they are inspired to see it in themselves.”

The Character Ethic teaches that there are basic principles of effective living and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character.
To focus on technique is like cramming your way through school.
“What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.”—Thomas Edison
We have many maps in our heads and each can be divided into two main categories: maps of the way things are, or realities, and maps of the way things should be, or values.
“We interpret everything we experience through these mental maps. We seldom question their accuracy; we’re usually even unaware that we have them. We simply assume that the way we see things is the way they really are or the way they should be.”
“To try to change outward attitudes and behaviors do very little good in the long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms from which those attitudes and behaviors flow.”
“We see the world, not as it is, but as we are—or, as we are conditioned to see it.”
“Our paradigms, correct or incorrect, are the sources of our attitudes and behaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others.”
“If we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps appropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors. But if we want to make significant, quantum change, we need to work on our basic paradigms.”
“Paradigms are inseparable from character. Being is seeing in the human dimension. And what we see is highly interrelated to what we are.”
“Paradigms are powerful because they create the lens through which we see the world. The power of a paradigm shift is the essential power of quantum change, whether that shift is an instantaneous or a slow and deliberate process.”
On practices vs. principles: “Practices are situationally specific. Principles are deep, fundamental truths that have universal application.”
“Principles are the territory. Values are maps. When we value correct principles, we have the truth—a knowledge of things as they are.”
“Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education.”
“The way we see the problem is the problem.”
“The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.”—Albert Einstein
“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”—Aristotle
“Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny.”
Stephen defines a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. To make something a habit in our lives, Stephen explains, we need to have all three.

“Private victories precede public victories.”

True effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose).

Effectiveness lies in the balance—what Stephen calls the P/PC Balance. P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs.
“I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.”—Henry David Thoreau
“We are not our feelings. We are not our moods. We are not even our thoughts. The very fact that we can think about these things separates us from them and from the animal world.”
There are three social maps—three theories of determinism widely accepted, independently or in combination, to explain the nature of man:

Genetic determinism. This basically says your grandparents did it to you. That’s why you have such a temper.
Psychic determinism. This basically says your parents did it to you.
Environmental determinism. This basically says your boss is doing it to you—or your spouse, or that bratty teenager, or your economic situation, or national policies. Someone or something in your environment is responsible for your situation.
Between what happens to you, or the stimulus and your response to it is your freedom or power to choose that response. (Sam: this is similar to what Ryan Holiday writes in The Obstacle Is the Way.)
“Between stimulus and response, man has the freedom to choose.”
“Proactive people can carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them. They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn’t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not.”
“The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values—carefully thought about, selected and internalized values.”
“Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological. But their response to the stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or response.”
“It’s not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us.”
Victor Frankl suggests that there are three central values in life:

The experiential, or that which happens to us
The creative, or that which we bring into existence
The attitudinal, or our response in difficult circumstances such as terminal illness.
“What matters most is how we respond to what we experience in life.”
“Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and magnifying, causing their Circle of Influence to increase.”
The problems we face fall in one of three areas:

Direct control. Problems involving our own behavior
Indirect control. Problems involving other people’s behavior
No control. Problems we can do nothing about, such as our past or situational realities. (Sam: this is similar to what William B. Irvine writes in A Guide to The Good Life: “There are things over which we have complete control, things over which we have no control at all, and things over which we have some but not complete control.”)
“‘Begin with the end in mind’ is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There’s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation, to all things.”
“Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things. Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.”
“The two additional unique human endowments that enable us to expand our proactivity and to exercise personal leadership in our lives are imagination and conscience.”
“Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes you because it forces you to think through your priorities deeply, carefully, and to align your behavior with your beliefs. As you do, other people begin to sense that you’re not being driven by everything that happens to you. You have a sense of mission about what you’re trying to do and you are excited about.”
A good affirmation has five basic ingredients:

It’s personal
It’s positive
It’s present tense
It’s visual
It’s emotional.
An example of an affirmation: “It is deeply satisfying (emotional) that I (personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, love, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my children misbehave.” (Sam: Jack Canfield writes about the power of affirmations and visualization in The Success Principles.)

“The challenge is not to manage time, but to manage ourselves.”
“You simply can’t think efficiency with people. You think effectiveness with people and efficiency with things.”
“Peace of mind comes when your life is in harmony with true principles and values and in no other way.”

“Not only do you have to decide what results you are committed to, but also the kind of person that you’re committed to becoming”.

“Remember, anything you want that’s valuable requires that you break through some short-term pain in order to gain long-term pleasure”.
“It’s not the events of our lives that shape us, but our beliefs as to what those events mean”.

“Whenever something happens in your life, your brain asks two questions: 1) Will this mean pain or pleasure? 2) What must I do now to avoid pain and/or gain pleasure?”

“Global beliefs are the giant beliefs we have about everything in our lives: beliefs about our identities, people, work, time, money, and life itself, for that matter”.
“These giant generalizations are often phrased as is/am/are: ‘Life is…’ ‘I am…’ ‘People are …’.”
“If you can think of an idea as being like a tabletop with no legs, you’ll have a fair representation of why an idea doesn’t feel as certain as a belief. Without any legs, that tabletop won’t even stand up by itself. Belief, on the other hand, has legs. If you really believe, ‘I’m sexy’, how do you know you’re sexy? Isn’t it true that you have some references to support the idea—some experiences in life to back it up? Those are the legs that make your tabletop solid, that make your belief certain”.
“Sometimes we gather references through information we get from other people, or from books, tapes, movies, and so on. And sometimes we form references based solely on our imagination”.
“The strongest and most solid legs are formed by personal experiences that we have a lot of emotion attached to because they were painful or pleasurable experiences”.
“If you develop the absolute sense of certainty that powerful beliefs provide, then you can get yourself to accomplish virtually anything, including those things that other people are certain are impossible”.
“The most effective way is to get your brain to associate massive pain to the old belief”.
“New experiences trigger change only if they cause us to question our beliefs. Remember, whenever we believe something, we no longer question it in any way”.
“If you question anything enough, eventually you’ll begin to doubt it”.
“I’ve classified beliefs into three categories: opinions, beliefs, and convictions”.
“An opinion is something we feel relatively certain about, but the certainty is only temporary because it can be changed easily”.
“A belief, on the other hand, is formed when we begin to develop a much larger base of reference legs, and especially reference legs about which we have strong emotion”.
“A conviction, however, eclipses a belief, primarily because of the emotional intensity a person links to an idea. A person holding a conviction does not only feel certain, but gets angry if their conviction is even questioned. A person with a conviction is unwilling to ever question their references, even for a moment; they are totally resistant to new input, often to the point of obsession”.
“Someone with a conviction is so passionate about their belief that they’re even willing to risk rejection or make a fool of themselves for the sake of their conviction”.
“So how can you create a conviction? 1) Start with the basic belief. 2) Reinforce your belief by adding new and more powerful references. 3) Then find a triggering event, or else create one of your own. Associate yourself fully by asking, ‘What will it cost me if I don’t?’ Ask questions that create emotional intensity for you. 4) Finally, take action. Each action you take strengthens your commitment and raises the level of your emotional intensity and conviction”.
“The way to expand our lives is to model the lives of those people who are already succeeding. It’s just a matter of asking questions: ‘What do you believe makes you different? What are the beliefs you have that separate you from others?'”
“At the end of each day I ask myself these questions: What have I learned today? What did I contribute or improve? What did I enjoy?”
“NAC is a step-by-step process that can condition your nervous system to associate pleasure to those things you want to continuously move toward and pain to those things you need to avoid in order to succeed consistently in your life without constant effort or willpower”.
“We all want to change either 1) how we feel about things or 2) our behaviors”.
“There are three specific beliefs about responsibility that a person must have if they’re going to create long-term change: 1) First, we must believe, ‘Something must change’—not that it should change, not that it could or ought to, but that it absolutely must. Second, we must not only believe that things must change, but we must believe, ‘I must change it’. Third, we have to believe, ‘I can change it’.”
“Each time we experience a significant amount of pain or pleasure, our brains search for the cause and record it in our nervous systems to enable us to make better decisions about what to do in the future”.
“Any time you experience significant amounts of pain or pleasure, your brain immediately searches for the cause. It uses the following three criteria. 1. Your brain looks for something that appears to be unique. 2. Your brain looks for something that seems to be happening simultaneously. 3. Your brain looks for consistency”.
“So often we blame the wrong cause, and thereby close ourselves off from possible solutions”.
“The difference between acting badly or brilliantly is not based on your ability, but on the state of your mind and/or body in any given moment”.
“Emotion is created by motion”.
“Focus on where you want to go, not on what you fear”.
“Our ability to change the way we feel depends upon our ability to change our submodalities”.
“You’ve got to be in a determined state in order to succeed”.
“I began to realize that thinking itself is nothing but the process of asking and answering questions”.
“Quality questions create a quality life”.
“A genuine quality of life comes from consistent, quality questions”.
“Questions accomplish three specific things: 1. Questions immediately change what we’re focusing on and therefore how we feel. 2. Questions change what we delete. 3. Questions change the resources available to us”.
“You and I can change how we feel in an instant, just by changing our focus”.
“One of the ways that I’ve discovered to increase the quality of my life is to model the habitual questions of people I really respect”.
“The words you habitually choose also affect how you communicate with yourself and therefore what you experience”.
“People with an impoverished vocabulary live an impoverished emotional life; people with rich vocabularies have a multi-hued palette of colors with which to paint their experience, not only for others, but for themselves as well”.
“Simply by changing your habitual vocabulary—the words you consistently use to describe the emotions of your life—you can instantaneously change how you think, how you feel, and how you live”.
“If we want to change our lives and shape our destiny, we need to consciously select the words we’re going to use, and we need to constantly strive to expand our level of choice”.
“Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible—the foundation for all success in life”.
“All goal setting must be immediately followed by both the development of a plan, and massive and consistent action toward its fulfillment”.
“It’s not just getting a goal that matters, but the quality of life you experience along the way”.
“Remember, our goal is not to ignore the problems of life, but to put ourselves in better mental and emotional states where we can not only come up with solutions but act upon them”.
“We must remember that all decision-making comes down to values clarification”.
“The only way for us to have long-term happiness is to live by our highest ideals, to consistently act in accordance with what we believe our life is truly about”.
“Many people know what they want to have, but have no idea of who they want to be”.
“Remember that your values—whatever they are—are the compass that is guiding you to your ultimate destiny”.
“Anytime you have difficulty making an important decision, you can be sure that it’s the result of being unclear about your values”.
“To value something means to place importance upon it; anything that you hold dear can be called a ‘value’.”
“So often people are too busy pursuing means values that they don’t achieve their true desire: their ends values”.
“The hierarchy of your values is controlling the way you make decisions in each moment”.
“We must remember, then, that any time we make a decision about what to do, our brain first evaluates whether that action can possibly lead to either pleasurable or painful states”.
“Most of us have created numerous ways to feel bad, and only a few ways to truly feel good”.
“How do we know if a rule empowers or disempowers us? There are three primary criteria: 1. It’s a disempowering rule if it’s impossible to meet. 2. A rule is disempowering if something that you can’t control determines whether your rule has been met or not. 3. A rule is disempowering if it gives you only a few ways to feel good and lots of ways to feel bad”.
“Once we design our values, we must decide what evidence we need to have before we give ourselves pleasure. We need to design rules that will move us in the direction of our values, that will clearly be achievable, using criteria we can control personally so that we’re ringing the bell instead of waiting for the outside world to do it”.
“If you ever feel angry or upset with someone, remember, it’s your rules that are upsetting you, not their behavior”.
“The ‘must’ and the ‘must never’ rules are threshold rules; the ‘should’ and ‘should never’ rules are personal standard rules”.
“Design your rules so that you’re in control, so that the outside world is not what determines whether you feel good or bad. Set it up so that it’s incredibly easy for you to feel good, and incredibly hard to feel bad”.
“The larger the number and greater the quality of our references, the greater our potential level of choices. A larger number and greater quality of references enables us to more effectively evaluate what things mean and what we can do”.
“Once again, it’s not our references, but our interpretations of them, the way we organize them—that clearly determine our beliefs”.
“The key is to expand the references that are available within your life. Consciously seek out experiences that expand your sense of who you are and what you’re capable of, as well as organize your references in empowering ways”.
“The way we use our references will determine how we feel, because whether something is good or bad is all based on what you’re comparing it to”.
“You are not even limited to your own personal experiences as references. You can borrow the references of other people”.
“Limited references create a limited life. If you want to expand your life, you must expand your references by pursuing ideas and experiences that wouldn’t be a part of your life if you didn’t consciously seek them out”.
“We all will act consistently with our views of who we truly are, whether that view is accurate or not”.
“As we develop new beliefs about who we are, our behavior will change to support the new identity”.
“If you’ve repeatedly attempted to make a particular change in your life, only to continually fall short, invariably the challenge is that you were trying to create a behavioral or emotional shift that was inconsistent with your belief about who you are”.
