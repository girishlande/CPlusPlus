There are 2 projects in this folder. 
One which will generate a third party library (simple library with single class)
Second which will consume this third party library

This project is mainly for demo of using cmake for creation of third party library and using it so that development 
can be divided into parts and we can use it 


Library is build and installed in C:\Girish-dev and C:\Girish folder. 
So when you build and run first project it should generate above 2 folders.
