Introduction
=============
Hello XXX
Good XXX
How are you today ? 


// OOPS
===========
what is virtual destructor and its use ?
what is benefit of run time polymorphism using virtual function?
what is difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?

Tell me How to avoid memory leaks in program.
what is deep copy?

write copy constructor for following class 
class Test {
  int * buffer; // this buffer can hold 100 integers
  public:
   // copy constructor
}
How will you write copy constructor ?
What is use of move constructor? 
what is use of assignment operator?
what is rule of 3 or rule of five ? 

tell me something about file handling in c++?

what is different types of memory allocations done by program?
what is use of static variables? 
Can you tell something about lifetime of variables declared in program ? 

what is mutable ? 
Sometimes there is requirement to modify one or more data members of class / struct through const function 
even though you donâ€™t want the function to update other members of class / struct

What is an inline function?

what is difference between reference and pointer ? 

Design
===========
can you tell me some class design principles?
which design patterns have you used ? 


ADVANCE C++
=============
what is use of forward declaration of class?
what is use of functor?
what is use of lambda function?
what is object slicing?

Data structures
==================
what is difference between STL vector and list?
what is time complexity of binary search algorithm?
how many comparisons will happen if n=5000?

Multi-threading
=================
Have you done any Multi-threading work ? 
Give example of Multi-threading function.
what is use of mutex ? 
what is re-entrant function?

UI (QT)
===============
what is queued connection?


Puzzles
===========
There are 2 singly linked lists with different head pointers but common tail nodes. 
Find first common node between these 2 linked lists in single pass. Number of nodes before this common node
can be different in both linked lists. 

Find middle element of singly linked list in one pass.

Find third last element in singly linked list in one pass. 

How to find height of the binary search tree. 

Find number of ways to climb stairs by climbing only one step or 2 steps at time


Domain knowledge
==================
what kind of domain knowledge do you have?
what did you learn in your experience in industry? 

// Programs
==================
how to check whether number is prime or not ? 
how to calculate nth number in Fibonacci series? 

Write function to print binary number of input decimal number
void printBinary(int decimal) {
   // your logic goes here 
}

// write a function to print all prime numbers between given 2 numbers.
// for e.g 
// printPrimeNumbers(10, 20)
// output:
// Prime numbers between 10 and 20 are 11, 13, 17, 19,
// write definition of following function declaration
void printPrimeNumbers(int a, int b);

// write a function to rotate input array by k elements
// e.g 
// Input : int a[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
// rotateArray(a, size, 3);
// Output : 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6
// write definition of following function
void rotateArray(int* arr, int size, int k);
